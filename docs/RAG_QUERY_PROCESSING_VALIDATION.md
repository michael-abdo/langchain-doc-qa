- Scalability: Horizontal scaling ready

## Issues Found and Resolved ✅

1. **Minor Issue**: Rate limiter cleanup could be more efficient
   - **Resolution**: Implemented periodic cleanup with configurable interval

2. **Enhancement**: Token counting could cache results
   - **Resolution**: Added internal caching for repeated query patterns

## Recommendations for Production

1. **Monitoring**: Implement dashboards for security event tracking
2. **Tuning**: Adjust complexity thresholds based on production load
3. **Enhancement**: Consider ML-based anomaly detection for advanced threats
4. **Scaling**: Implement distributed rate limiting for multi-instance deployments

## Final Validation Status: ✅ PASSED
